# CS50x - 2024 Problem Set Solutions
Welcome! This repository contains my personal solutions to the problem sets from Harvard's CS50x - 2024 course. These solutions represent my own approach to tackling the various challenges presented in each problem set.

> Note: Academic integrity is crucial to your learning journey. Before referencing any of my solutions, I strongly encourage you to give your best effort to solve each problem independently. Working through the problem sets yourself will deepen your understanding and contribute to your mastery of computer science fundamentals.
> The CS50 course provides guidelines on [Academic Honesty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/)  and respecting these principles is essential to gaining the full benefit from the course. Using these solutions without attempting to solve the problems first could hinder your learning and undermine the course’s intent.

## About the Solutions
Each solution here is tailored to the concepts and skills taught by Professor David J. Malan and the Harvard CS50 team for 2024. They’re shared here as a reference for those who have genuinely attempted the assignments and may need guidance or a different perspective on solving specific problems.
